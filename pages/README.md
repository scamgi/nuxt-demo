# pages folder

This folder contains the .vue files that represents somehow the pages of the webapp. Here is an example of a page structure:

pages/index.vue -> / (your homepage)
pages/about.vue -> /about
pages/products/index.vue -> /products
pages/products/[id].vue -> /products/123 (dynamic route - more on this later)
